   hey! I'm Matthew from the uk, currently studying computer science. I'm just trying to get my computer to do what I tell it.

<h2>Languages and tools</h2>
<p>    
    After learning the basic programming skills in VB.NET, I moved to Python to complete small projects such as discord bots. I am currently using HTML, CSS3, JS, Svelte and Python to create full stack web applications. Languages and other applications I use are listed below. <br> <br>

<h2>Favourite Projects</h2>  
<h3>simpleweather</h3>
<p>A simple weather app, using a flask backend, pulling weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. A user is able to input a postcode, and then view the weater for it. Or go to a user page where they can login and save postcodes for easy access at later dates. "Login with Google" is used for this project.</p>
<h3>discord.mc</h3>
<p>One of the most simple projects I have, just for creating a connection between minecraft and discord servers. Not overly complex, but it does the job.</p>
<h3>SchoolBot</h3>
<p>Made as a TechWithTim code jam project, this is one of the largest projects that I have completed, and a project that I have collaborated on. This is a discord bot designed for assistance while students are learning at home, possibly in a school discord server.</p>
